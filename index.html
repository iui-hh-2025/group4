    <h2 class="ai-title">What is AI?</h2>
    <h3 class="ai-subtitle">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
    <p class="ai-desc">With the recent proliferation of AI tools and chatbots, the concept of artificial intelligence has entered mainstream consciousness and is often seen as synonymous with popular products like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot. The truth, however, is that these chatbots that have become household names are more accurately categorized as generative AI, which is only one subset under the broad umbrella of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence has been around for decades and is actually an overarching term encompassing a group of technologies that enable computers and machines to mimic human thinking and processes like comprehension, problem-solving, decision-making, and creativity (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024; United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP], 2024). The field of artificial intelligence has been evolving since the 1950s and can be broadly understood as three nested subsets: (1) machine learning, (2) deep learning, and (3) generative AI (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024).
</p>
    <div class="ai-cards">
      <div class="ai-card">
        <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
        <p>The broadest subset within AI is machine learning, which encompasses a wide range of techniques or algorithms for training computers to learn, infer, predict, and make decisions based on historical data (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024). A common type of machine learning algorithm, known as a neural network, involves interconnected layers of nodes, modeled after the human brain's structural network, that process data and analyze patterns (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ai-card">
        <h4>Deep Learning</h4>
        <p>Nested within machine learning is a subset known as deep learning. Deep learning allows for an even more intricate simulation of the human brain and its complex decision-making capabilities through the use of deep neural networks (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024). In contrast to the simpler neural networks with only 1-2 hidden layers sometimes used in classic machine learning models, deep neural networks typically include hundreds of hidden layers. Most of today's AI applications are powered in some form by deep learning (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ai-card">
        <h4>Generative AI</h4>
        <p>Generative AI (gen AI) uses deep learning models, known as foundation models, to extend beyond pattern recognition and predictive analyses into the realm of content creation. By encoding and drawing from a simplified representation of its training data, gen AI is able to respond to users' prompts with original content in the form of text, images, videos, or audio (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024).</p>

    <h2>What is a Data Center?</h2>
    <p class="section-desc">Generative AI's foundation models must be trained on immense volumes of raw data, necessitating weeks of processing and millions of dollars (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024). Data centers are buildings that house the AI servers where these compute-intensive training processes occur. Take a look at the video below for a brief introduction into AI data centers and their impacts on our earth.</p>

        <h2>AI's Electricity & Water Demands</h2>
        <p>Building the foundation models that serve as the basis for many gen AI applications involves incredibly compute-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive training processes (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024). The data centers that house AI servers require massive amounts of water and energy to run (1 ChatGPT request consumes 10X the electricity of a Google Search) (UNEP, 2024). These demands on our earth's resources continue to grow at an exponential rate as the number of data centers across the globe surges (UNEP, 2024).</p>

      <h2>Combating Climate Change</h2>
      <p>Interestingly, AI has the potential to combat the very environmental issues to which it contributes. Its biggest benefits lie in its abilities to detect patterns and accurately predict future outcomes based on historical data, making it an invaluable tool for environmental monitoring, climate prediction, and sustainability research (UNEP, 2024). For example, AI technologies are already being used to chart methane emissions, map pollution levels, and track rising sea levels.

        <h3>Hidden Costs</h3>
        <p>A growing body of research is beginning to elucidate the hidden costs of artificial intelligence and its negative impacts on the environment–from its unsustainable consumption of energy, water, and rare minerals to its staggering production of greenhouse emissions and e-waste. The fact that data centers are frequently built in low-income or rural areas adds to the concerns regarding AI's role in exacerbating environmental injustices. Yet, the available research measuring the environmental consequences of AI is still limited.</p>
