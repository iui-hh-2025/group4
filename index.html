    <h2 class="ai-title">What is AI?</h2>
    <h3 class="ai-subtitle">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
    <p class="ai-desc">With the recent proliferation of AI tools and chatbots, the concept of artificial intelligence has entered mainstream consciousness and is often seen as synonymous with popular products like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot. The truth, however, is that these chatbots that have become household names are more accurately categorized as generative AI, which is only one subset under the broad umbrella of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence has been around for decades and is actually an overarching term encompassing a group of technologies that enable computers and machines to mimic human thinking and processes like comprehension, problem-solving, decision-making, and creativity (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024; United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP], 2024). The field of artificial intelligence has been evolving since the 1950s and can be broadly understood as three nested subsets: (1) machine learning, (2) deep learning, and (3) generative AI (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024).
</p>
    <div class="ai-cards">
      <div class="ai-card">
        <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
        <p>The broadest subset within AI is machine learning, which encompasses a wide range of techniques or algorithms for training computers to learn, infer, predict, and make decisions based on historical data (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024). A common type of machine learning algorithm, known as a neural network, involves interconnected layers of nodes, modeled after the human brain’s structural network, that process data and analyze patterns (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ai-card">
        <h4>Deep Learning</h4>
        <p>Nested within machine learning is a subset known as deep learning. Deep learning allows for an even more intricate simulation of the human brain and its complex decision-making capabilities through the use of deep neural networks (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024). In contrast to the simpler neural networks with only 1-2 hidden layers sometimes used in classic machine learning models, deep neural networks typically include hundreds of hidden layers. Most of today’s AI applications are powered in some form by deep learning (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ai-card">
        <h4>Generative AI</h4>
        <p>Generative AI (gen AI) uses deep learning models, known as foundation models, to extend beyond pattern recognition and predictive analyses into the realm of content creation. Foundation models must be trained on immense volumes of raw data, necessitating weeks of processing and millions of dollars (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024). By encoding and drawing from a simplified representation of its training data, gen AI is able to respond to users’ prompts with original content in the form of text, images, videos, or audio (Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024).</p>
