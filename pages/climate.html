    <!-- Overview of AI for Climate -->
    <section class="intro-section">
      <p class="intro-climate-p">
        Artificial Intelligence is rapidly becoming a critical tool in the fight against climate change.<br>
        This page explores both sides: how AI is being used for good, and what it takes to power that progress.
      </p>
      <h2>Where AI Helps</h2>
      <div class="intro-columns">
        <div class="intro-item">
          <div class="icon-placeholder"></div>
          <h3>Climate Prediction</h3>
          <p>AI improves forecasting of hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and other extreme events.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro-item">
          <div class="icon-placeholder"></div>
          <h3>Environmental Monitoring</h3>
          <p>AI tools analyze satellite and sensor data to track ecosystem changes and pollution levels.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro-item">
          <div class="icon-placeholder"></div>
          <h3>Sustainability Research</h3>
          <p>AI accelerates climate models and helps researchers understand complex environmental systems.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="climate-p">
        Artificial intelligence is transforming how we predict and respond to extreme weather. A leading example is Google DeepMind’s <strong>GraphCast</strong>, a next-generation forecasting model that delivers 10-day global weather predictions with unprecedented accuracy and speed.
      </p>
       <div class="iframe-box">
          <div class="iframe-container">
            <iframe class="myiframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-KFO0pES-zQ" title="Why AI Creates Better Weather Forecasts" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>
       </div>
      <p class="climate-p">
        Unlike traditional physics-based systems that rely on vast supercomputing infrastructure, GraphCast generates its forecasts in under a minute using a single Google TPU. 
         This level of efficiency not only accelerates disaster preparedness but also reduces the energy demands—and carbon footprint—typically associated with high-resolution modeling.
         Compared to conventional models like <strong>HRES</strong> (High-Resolution Forecast), which simulates a single possible weather outcome at approximately 9 km resolution,
         GraphCast learns from decades of historical data to anticipate atmospheric changes with greater speed and breadth. 
         Its output is both faster and potentially more versatile, offering new opportunities for early warning systems around the world.
        </p> 
        <div class="image-placeholder"><img src="../images/graphcast_vs_hres.jpeg" alt="GraphCast comparison to HRES" style="display:block; width:600px; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:0 auto 1em auto;"></div>
      <p class="climate-p">
        GraphCast is just one example of how AI is transforming weather forecasting. As we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible, we can expect even more accurate and timely predictions to save lives and protect communities around the world.
      </p>
      <h3>From Forecasting to City Planning with Extended Reality and AI</h3>
      <p class="climate-p">
        Beyond forecasting, artificial intelligence is being integrated into how we plan our cities and respond to future risk. A new wave of projects merges Extended Reality (XR) with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to create immersive simulations. 
        Using XR, planners can “walk through” flood zones, visualize wildfire spread, or simulate infrastructure failure, helping city officials and residents alike engage with climate risks in a more tangible, interactive way.
      </p>
        <div class="iframe-box">
          <div class="iframe-container">
            <iframe class="myiframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zHDHDC6dWS4" title="AI and GIS" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>
       </div>
      <p class="climate-p">
        A company named Esri is combining geographic information systems (GIS) with extended reality (XR) to help cities prepare for floods, fires, and infrastructure stress. 
        By building interactive 3D digital twins, communities can visualize disaster scenarios in advance and make better-informed planning decisions.<br> 
        The potential for AI integration with this technology is unprecedented.
      </p>
      <h3>Looking Ahead: Innovation With Accountability</h3>
      <p class="climate-p">
        AI’s expanding role in climate resilience is full of promise, from rapid forecasting and immersive urban planning to disaster response and early warning systems. But as cities become denser and weather events grow more extreme, the tools we build must not only be powerful, but also fair, inclusive, and transparent.<br>
        <br>
        Organizations like the U.N.’s Global Initiative on Resilience to Natural Hazards through AI are beginning to define what responsible use of AI in disaster management should look like: better data practices, stronger early warnings, and clear guidelines for accountability. 
        But still, critical gaps remain, especially for poorer regions with weak sensor infrastructure or limited access to computational resources.<br>
        <br>
        Private companies are stepping in with satellite networks and AI-powered platforms, but experts stress that ultimate responsibility must remain with trusted public institutions. 
        As Johan Stander—director of services for the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and a partner of the SOFF initiative—noted,“You can’t go to a machine and say, ‘OK, you were wrong. Answer me, what’s going on?’” Human oversight is still essential.<br>
        <br>
        The challenge now is not just to build faster models, but to ensure that these systems serve everyone, not just the well-connected or well-funded. 
        When AI is guided by purpose, equity, and collaboration, it has the potential to not only predict the future, but help us shape a better one.<br>
